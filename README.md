# Weather Forecast Application

This project is a **Weather Forecast Application** built with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and a small amount of custom CSS for layout.

The application provides a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface to check weather conditions by **city name** or **your current location**.  
It also includes an **autocomplete city search**, **recent searches**, **extreme temperature alerts**, and **dynamic background changes** for rainy weather.
